# ymp
YouTube Media Player. Browse and play YouTube music/audio from the terminal. 

## Installation (Linux)
So far, the only way to use ymp is:
1. Download the latest ymp binary from [releases](https://github.com/trap251/ymp/releases)
2. Place it in the binaries folder i.e. ~/.local/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/
3. Run 'ymp' in the terminal to use the application

#### Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:
1. yt-dlp
2. mpv

I use arch btw, but this should work on any linux distro.
